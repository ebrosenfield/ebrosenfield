                    <h1>Final Project: "Singing" Penguin</h1>
                    <p>For my final project, I am going to hide electronics in the sweater of my stuffed Penguin, 
                        Mel. When I touch Mel's left flipper, a buzzer will play an odd and annoying version of
                        the chorus from Let it Go.

                        his left flipper. To do this I will need to accomplish the following: </p>
                    <p>(1) Hide a capacitive sensor on his flipper to trigger a response
                            when someone grabs his flipper.
                    </p>
                    <p>(2) Write a program to play the tune from Let it Go on a passive buzzer.</p>
                    <p>(3) Get the capacitive sensor and the passive buzzer to work together.
                    </p>
                    <p>(4) Obscure the electronics in Mel's sweater, so it can be easily taken apart
                        and removed.

                    <p>Here's what the schematic of my circuit looks like. It's really quite simple and 
                        is broken into two parts. On the left is the part of my circuit that handles 
                    capacitive sensing. I used a 1M Ohm resistor, which means that a person has to make 
                contact with the metal end of the alligator clip to trigger a response. On the right is 
            a very simple circuit of the buzzer. </p>

                    the pieces together. But that's okay because now I still have all my parts available
                to tinker with for the rest of this COVID-19 - stay home and avoid being bored - period of time.  </p>

                    <p>The hardest part of this project was re-teaching myself how to read sheet music. As you will 
                        see later in my code snippet, I used the pitches.h library to translate each note of the 
                        melody. To store information about each note, I created 3 arrays of the same length. The array
                        for Melody stored all of the Tones for each note, the array Duration stored how long each note 
                        played, and the array Pauses stored how long the buzzer should pause before playing the next
                        note. Overall, the melody is not perfect and still sounds weird since it is played by a buzzer.
                        But my goal was to make the melody RECOGNIZEABLE, which I think it is.
