                    <h1>Emily's Assignment 4! High(ER) Voltage and Transistors!</h1>
                    <p>Here is all the documentation for assignment 4, where I used a 
                        MOSFET transistor to turn on an LED strip. I also used a much 
                        higher voltage than the previous assignments by using a 12V 
                        wall plug. I used a Infrared Remote to control the transistor 
                        & the LED strip. When you press 5 on the button the LED strip 
                        will turn on for 2 seconds.</p>

                    <p>Here's the circuit I built. I used the IR Remote 
                        library to program the IR receiver that I used. 
                        When the receiver detects that the button five has been 
                        pressed, I analog write to the transistor to turn it, and the 
                        LED strip on for 2 seconds. </p>

                    <p>Here's the schematic of my circuit. You can also see the calculations 
                        that I did to make sure my circuit was safe. I looked at the max 
                        current and voltage ratings of my transistor and then calculated 
                        the max current of the LED strip. The LED strip current is lower than 
                        the max current of the resistor - so it is safe to turn on.</p>
